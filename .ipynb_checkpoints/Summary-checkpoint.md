# Which model has a lower loss?
> The LSTM Stock Predictor Using Closing Prices has a lower loss in the predicted values
# Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
> Again the LSTM Stock Predicto Using Closing Prices tracks better the actual values over time
# Which window size works best for the model?
> Window size 1 seems to work best for both models as the Predicted values are closer to the Real values. Window size 10 provides models that track actual values worse over time
